## Summary

`dmarc-cat` is a small command-line utility to analyze and display in a usable manner the content of the DMARC XML reports sent by the various email providers around the globe.  Should work properly on UNIX (FreeBSD, Linux, etc.) and now Windows systems.

## Installation

As with many Go utilities, a simple

    go install github.com/keltia/dmarc-cat@latest

is enough to fetch, build and install. On some systems you may need install the `gpgme` library's development package and to add some environment variables to enable the Go and C compilers to find the `gpgme` include files and libraries.

    sudo pacman -S gpgme # or sudo apt install -y gpgme-dev
    CGO_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" CGO_LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" go install ...

On Windows systems, GPG support is disabled in the `archive` module so you don't need to compile any non-Go code and the above `go get` command should work directly in a Powershell window.

### Linux

#### Arch Linux
[![dmarc-cat on AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/dmarc-cat?label=dmarc-cat)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dmarc-cat/)
[![dmarc-cat-git on AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/dmarc-cat-git?label=dmarc-cat-git)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dmarc-cat-git/)

Dmarc-cat is available on the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository):
- [dmarc-cat](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dmarc-cat/) (release package)
- [dmarc-cat-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dmarc-cat-git/) (git package)

You can install it using your [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers) of choice.

Example:
```console
$ yay -Sy dmarc-cat
```

## Dependencies

Aside from the standard library, I use `github.com/intel/tfortools` to generate tables.

    go get -u github.com/intel/tfortools

It also use my own module `github.com/keltia/archive` to handle the various archive types.

If you use Go modules, it should all work automatically.

```

## Columns

The full XML grammar is available [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489#appendix-C)

The report has several columns:

- `IP` is matching IP address
- `Count` is the number of times this IP was present
- `From` is the `From:` header value
- `RFrom` is the envelope `From` value
- `RDKIM` is the result from DKIM checking
- `RSPF` is the result from SPF checking

## Supported formats

The file sent by MTAs can differ in format, some providers send zip files with both csv and XML files, some directly send compressed XML files.  The `archive` module should support all these, please open an issue if not.

## Tests

Getting close to 90% coverage.
